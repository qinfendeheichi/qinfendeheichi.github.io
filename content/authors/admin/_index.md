Hang Du is a Ph.D. candidate in Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. He earned his B.Sc. in Computer Science from Jilin University in China and an M.S. in Software Engineering from UC Irvine, where he continued on to pursue doctoral studies beginning in 2022. His research centers on advancing software testing, with a focus on mutation testing, dynamic analysis, and program comprehension. In his prior work, Hang investigated the foundations of mutation testing and analyzed the propagation of faults through the RIPR model (Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Reveal). These studies contribute to the broader effort of improving the reliability and effectiveness of software testing techniques, deepening our understanding of how faults manifest, propagate, and can ultimately be revealed by tests.
